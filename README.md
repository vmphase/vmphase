**Software & Distributed Systems Engineer**, focusing on stability, predictable behavior, and decisions that make systems easier to understand.

Previously worked mostly with repositories under NDA and used a self-hosted git setup. In my free time, I contribute to OSS and collaborate with engineers who value pragmatic engineering.
