**Software & Distributed Systems Engineer**

Previously worked mostly with repositories under NDA and used a self-hosted git setup.   
I prefer simple solutions over clever ones, automate what makes sense, and like honest discussions about trade-offs (especially when they result in quieter systems and fewer late-night fixes).
