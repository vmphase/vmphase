**Software & Distributed Systems Engineer**, focusing on stability, predictable behavior, and decisions that make systems easier to understand.

I prefer simple solutions over clever ones, automate what makes sense, and like honest discussions about trade-offs (especially when they result in quieter systems and fewer late-night fixes). 
In my free time, I contribute to OSS and collaborate with engineers who value pragmatic engineering.
